<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Priyanshu Hembram, and I am currently pursuing my B.Tech 
  in Computer Science and Engineering from Odisha University of Technology
   and Research, Bhubaneswar. I have a strong interest in technology,
    programming, and exploring how computers work. I enjoy learning about
     web development and data structures, and I’m currently working on
      improving my skills through online courses like full-stack 
      development and DSA. I believe in building a strong technical 
      foundation that will help me in future projects and career opportunities.</p>

<p>Outside academics, I like to stay active in different creative and 
  social activities. Photography, especially nature shots, is something
   I enjoy and sometimes share on social media. I also enjoy spending time
    on Instagram watching reels and getting inspired by creative content.
     I try to balance fun and learning, whether it’s by participating in
      college events or collaborating with classmates on group presentations.
       These activities help me grow both personally and professionally.
</p>

<p>In the future, I aim to become a capable full-stack developer who 
  can contribute to impactful tech solutions. I’m also working on 
  building a strong online presence through platforms like LinkedIn
   and GitHub. I value consistency, self-growth, and learning from 
   every experience. With the right mindset and dedication, I’m 
   confident I can achieve my goals and make the most of every 
   opportunity that comes my way.</p>
